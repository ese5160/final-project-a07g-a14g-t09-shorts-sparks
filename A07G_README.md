### Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS)

#### H.1 Overview

In normal operation, the router will be powered from a wall outlet, simultaneously charging the backup battery if necessary. On a power outage, the power source will switch to the battery. On detecting this switch the motors will not operate and the job will be paused.

The router will have motors to control the orientation of the material being shaped and the position and speed of a drill bit that will perform the subtractive manufacturing operation. In total, the router will use 4 motors: three stepper motors and 1 DC motor. The DC motor will control the speed of the drill bit rotation. One stepper will be attached along the z axis of the cyllindrical material, and this motor will control its theta axis or rotational orientation. The drill bit will be perpendicular to both the z axis of the material and the plane of the macine base plate. One stepper will act as a linear actuator, rotating a threaded rod that is parallel to the material z axis and ofset above the material. This linear actuaor also holds the drill bit jig, thereby moving the head of the drill bit. The final stepper motor will similarly act as a linear actuator to move the drill bit up and down in the direction it points.

We plan on using encoders as sensors on each stepper motor. We would like to design a custom closed loop feedback PCB (1 per motor in final assembly). This board would include a motor driver, an additional MCU, and a thermistor.

There were be a micro SD card to hold the cnc instruction file (G-code). This is also where current job progress will be stored in any pausing scenario.

### Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

#### S.1 Overview

The user interface will contain a upload portal to send the machining file. It will also contain some matchine settings that the user will adjust before beginning the job. The interface will have control button such as start and pause. There will also be status details such as idle/waiting for a job, actively running, finished job on machine, and paused due to power outage.

On a power outage, the job will be paused. The current state of the system will be stored, and upon restoration of primary power, router motors will reset and restore the proper position.

The addition MCUs in the closed loop stepper motor module will run on bare metal to process the encoder data in a control loop. The main board's MCU (running the RTOS) will communicate with each of these boards over I2C, sending the sub-instructions to each motor's MCU from the overall g-code that determines all of the necessary operations. This MCU will then interface with the motor controller, including the feedback loop. The thermistor will be used to monitor thermals.

The G-code instructions, stored on the micro SD card, will be iteratively accessed (SPI) and distributed as the machine operates.

#### S.2 Users

2. How are ‚ÄúcbufRx‚Äù and ‚ÄúcbufTx‚Äù initialized? Where is the library that defines them (please list the *C file they come from).
3. Where are the character arrays where the RX and TX characters are being stored at the end? Please mention their name and size.
Tip: Please note cBufRx and cBufTx are structures.
4. Where are the interrupts for UART character received and UART character sent defined?
5. What are the callback functions that are called when:
   1. A character is received? (RX)
   2. A character has been sent? (TX)
6. Explain what is being done on each of these two callbacks and how they relate to the cbufRx and cbufTx buffers.
7. Draw a diagram that explains the program flow for UART receive ‚Äì starting with the user typing a character and ending with how that characters ends up in the circular buffer ‚ÄúcbufRx‚Äù. Please make reference to specific functions in the starter code.
8. Draw a diagram that explains the program flow for the UART transmission ‚Äì starting from a string added by the program to the circular buffer ‚ÄúcbufTx‚Äù and ending on characters being shown on the screen of a PC (On Teraterm, for example).
