### Overall Project Updates / Differences from A00G proposal

| Original | Current |
| -------- | ------- |
| Foam cyllinders 3d model prototypes |  Copper clad FR4 for milling PCB prototypes |
| r(z), y, theta (cyllinder) cnc | x, y, z cnc |
| Battery backup power in wall power outage case | Approved removal of battery as PCB milling times are faster so it is less expected and a less significant issue to lose power in the middle of a job |

## 2 Understanding the Starter Code

1. What does ‚ÄúInitializeSerialConsole()‚Äù do? In said function, what is ‚ÄúcbufRx‚Äù and ‚ÄúcbufTx‚Äù? What type of data structure is it?

-  It initializes the UART circular buffers (RX and TX), configures the usart module and callback functions, set the priority for USART interrupts, and begins reading to the buffer.

```
/**
 * @brief Initializes the UART and registers callbacks.
 */
void InitializeSerialConsole(void)
{
    // Initialize circular buffers for RX and TX
	cbufRx = circular_buf_init((uint8_t *)rxCharacterBuffer, RX_BUFFER_SIZE);
   cbufTx = circular_buf_init((uint8_t *)txCharacterBuffer, TX_BUFFER_SIZE);

    // Configure USART and Callbacks
	configure_usart();
    configure_usart_callbacks();
    NVIC_SetPriority(SERCOM4_IRQn, 10);

    usart_read_buffer_job(&usart_instance, (uint8_t *)&latestRx, 1); // Kicks off constant reading of characters

	// Add any other calls you need to do to initialize your Serial Console
}
```

- cbufRx and cbufTx are circular buffer handlers, or pointers to the circular buffer defined in circular_buffer.c

```
 // The definition of our circular buffer structure is hidden from the user
 struct circular_buf_t {
	 uint8_t * buffer;
	 size_t head;
	 size_t tail;
	 size_t max; //of the buffer
	 bool full;
 };
 ```

2. How are ‚ÄúcbufRx‚Äù and ‚ÄúcbufTx‚Äù initialized? Where is the library that defines them (please list the *C file they come from).

- They are initialized by calling a function circular_but_init() with parameters cooresponding to rx and tx and their buffer sizes, respectively. This function is defined in circular_buffer.c. It creates an instance of the cbuf type struct using malloc to allocate sufficient memory on the heap. Then it sets the values of the elements of the struct accordingly with the parameters of the function call, and returns the newly created cbuf by reference (cbuf_handle_t is a pointer to the memory where the data is stored).

in serial console.c
```
cbufRx = circular_buf_init((uint8_t *)rxCharacterBuffer, RX_BUFFER_SIZE);
cbufTx = circular_buf_init((uint8_t *)txCharacterBuffer, TX_BUFFER_SIZE);
```

in circular_buffer.c
```
cbuf_handle_t circular_buf_init(uint8_t* buffer, size_t size)
{
	// assert(buffer && size);

	 cbuf_handle_t cbuf = malloc(sizeof(circular_buf_t));
	 //assert(cbuf);

	 cbuf->buffer = buffer;
	 cbuf->max = size;
	 circular_buf_reset(cbuf);

	// assert(circular_buf_empty(cbuf));

	 return cbuf;
}
```

3. Where are the character arrays where the RX and TX characters are being stored at the end? Please mention their name and size.
Tip: Please note cBufRx and cBufTx are structures.
4. Where are the interrupts for UART character received and UART character sent defined?
5. What are the callback functions that are called when:
   1. A character is received? (RX)
   2. A character has been sent? (TX)
6. Explain what is being done on each of these two callbacks and how they relate to the cbufRx and cbufTx buffers.
7. Draw a diagram that explains the program flow for UART receive ‚Äì starting with the user typing a character and ending with how that characters ends up in the circular buffer ‚ÄúcbufRx‚Äù. Please make reference to specific functions in the starter code.
8. Draw a diagram that explains the program flow for the UART transmission ‚Äì starting from a string added by the program to the circular buffer ‚ÄúcbufTx‚Äù and ending on characters being shown on the screen of a PC (On Teraterm, for example). Please make reference to specific functions in the starter code.
9. What is done on the function ‚ÄústartStasks()‚Äù in main.c? How many threads are started?

## 3 Debug Logger Module

Commit your functioning Debug Logger Module to your GitHub repo, and make comments that are in Doxygen style.

2. Where on the circuit board can you attach / solder to?
3. What are critical settings for the logic analyzer?

### Hardware Photo
